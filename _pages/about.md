I am an MSc student in AI at Imperial College London - currently enrolled in taught courses addressing modern connectionist AI approaches, 
as well as a number of courses on "Good Old Fashioned AI". As a novice, I have opted for an egalitarian prior, and believe that the 
"right answer" will probably draw from both schools of thought; consequently, I am also learning about neuro-symbolic approaches to AI 
as part of an Independent Study Module under the supervision of [Prof. A Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/).

## Research Experience
I am driven by curiosity and a passion for tackling challenging problems in subjects I am interested in.

My academic interest is in deep learning, especially when applied to problems in computer vision. I have also recently developed an interest 
in generative modelling and its ability to excel in the creation of music based on motifs and repitition, such as here 
by [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/transformer-autoencoder). 


I have spent considerable time performing research, having worked on [pixel detectors](publication/2019-09-charge-sharing) with 
[B. Nachman](https://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/) at LBNL whilst at UC Berkeley. Subsequently performing computational analyses 
of [supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model](files/projects/Alex_Spies-DESY_summer_essay.pdf) (of particle physics) as a summer 
intern at DESY[^1]. And most recently, carrying out an MPhys project on automated atrial fibrillation diagnosis using LSTMs and CNNs at the 
University of Manchester[^2].

Having learnt about both the incredible progress and thorny challenges present in the fields of deep learning and AI more generally, 
I decided to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London, specializing in AI. At present I am most excited by neuro-symbolic approaches to AI 
as these may yield models which address the shortcomings of both methods individually; yielding greater data efficiency, and 
(out of distribution) generalizability, whilst also allowing for easier integration of expert knowledge and vastly superior 
interpretability (a desirable feature for algorithms which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous).


In the research I have participated in so far, I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to a number of applications of 
machine learning and I feel that these experiences have illustrated the potential of AI to improve people's lives.
