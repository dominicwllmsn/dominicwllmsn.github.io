I am an MSc student in AI at Imperial College London - currently enrolled in taught courses addressing modern connectionist AI approaches, 
as well as a number of courses on "Good Old Fashioned AI". As a novice, I have opted for an egalitarian prior, and believe that the 
"right answer" will probably draw from both schools of thought; consequently, I am also learning about neuro-symbolic approaches to AI 
as part of an Independent Study Module under the supervision of [Prof. A Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/).

## Research Experience
My academic interest is in deep learning, especially when applied to problems in computer vision. I have also recently developed an interest 
in generative modelling and its ability to excel in the creation of music based upon motifs and repetition, such as here 
by [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/transformer-autoencoder). 

I have spent considerable time performing research, having worked with machine learning models in 
[quantum chemistry](publication/2019-09-charge-sharing) with [P.L.P Popelier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VlFNR0wAAAAJ&hl=en) 
in the Quantum Chemical Topology group at the University of Manchester. I then worked on utilising transfer learning to 
[detect tumours in MRI images of the brain](files/projects/Alex_Spies-DESY_summer_essay.pdf) as a research intern in the Manchester Computer 
Science Department with [F. Costen](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/fumie.costen.html). Deciding to develop a pretrained variational 
autoencoder in this project based on a separate dataset prompted me to research further into deep learning, and generative deep learning 
specifically.

In the research I have participated in so far, I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to a number of applications of 
machine learning and I feel that these experiences have illustrated the potential of AI to improve people's lives.

Having learnt about both the incredible progress and thorny challenges present in the fields of deep learning and AI more generally, 
I decided to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London, specializing in AI. At present I am most excited by neuro-symbolic approaches to AI 
as these may yield models which address the shortcomings of both methods individually; yielding greater data efficiency, and 
(out of distribution) generalizability, whilst also allowing for easier integration of expert knowledge and vastly superior 
interpretability (a desirable feature for algorithms which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous).
