I am an MSc student in AI at Imperial College London - currently in my first semester recieving taught courses addressing modern connectionist AI 
approaches, as well as a number of courses on "Good Old Fashioned AI". My main interest is in the use of transfer learning to utilse the relevant 
knowledge gained from a source learning scenario and applying it to a related task. 

## Research Experience
My academic interest is in deep learning, especially when applied to problems in computer vision. I have also recently developed an interest 
in generative modelling and its ability to excel in the creation of music based upon motifs and repetition, such as here 
by [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/transformer-autoencoder). 

I have spent considerable time performing research, initially working with machine learning models in 
[quantum chemistry](publication/2019-02-topological-compression) in the Quantum Chemical Topology group at the University of Manchester[^1].

I then worked on leveraging transfer learning to [detect tumours in MRI images of the brain](files/projects/Alex_Spies-DESY_summer_essay.pdf) 
as a research intern in the University of Manchester Computer Science Department[^2]. Developing a pretrained variational 
autoencoder in this project (based on a separate image dataset) prompted me to research further into deep learning, and generative deep learning 
specifically.

In the research I have participated in so far, I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to a number of applications of 
machine learning and I feel that these experiences have illustrated the potential of AI to improve people's lives.

Having learnt about both the incredible progress and thorny challenges present in the fields of deep learning and AI more generally, 
I decided to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London, specializing in AI. At present I am most excited by neuro-symbolic approaches to AI 
as these may yield models which address the shortcomings of both methods individually; yielding greater data efficiency, and 
(out of distribution) generalizability, whilst also allowing for easier integration of expert knowledge and vastly superior 
interpretability (a desirable feature for algorithms which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous).
