I am an MSc student in AI at Imperial College London - currently in my first semester recieving taught courses addressing both modern machine
learning approaches such as Reinforcement Learning, as well as a number of courses on logic-based AI. My main interest is in the use of transfer learning to apply the relevant knowledge gained from a source task to a related task, especially in creating more data-efficient learning algorithms. 

Recently I have developed an interest in generative modelling and its ability to excel in the creation of music based upon motifs and repetition, such as here by [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/transformer-autoencoder). 

## Research Experience
I have thoroughly enjoyed the two research internships I have been able to participate in so far. My first exposure to machine learning models was in [quantum chemistry](publication/2019-02-topological-compression) in the Quantum Chemical Topology group at the University of Manchester[^1]. Here I created [simulations of topological atoms and molecules](https://dominicwllmsn.github.io/projects/1_qct-compression/) and studied their energy decomposition as they were brought together and compressed.

I then worked on leveraging transfer learning to [detect tumours in MRI images of the brain](dominicwllmsn.github.io/projects/2_mri-transfer/) as a research intern in the University of Manchester Computer Science Department[^2]. Developing a pretrained variational autoencoder in this project (based on a separate image dataset) prompted me to research further into deep learning, and generative deep learning specifically.

In the research I have participated in so far, I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to a number of applications of machine learning and I feel that this has illustrated the potential of AI to be applied to a variety of interesting problem areas.

Having learnt about both the incredible progress and present challenges of deep learning and AI more generally, I decided to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London, specializing in AI. At present I am most excited by domain adaptation/transfer learning, especially when applied to data-scarce target domains such as in medical imaging; ideally yielding greater data efficiency and (out of distribution) generalisability.
