The Quantum Chemical Topology group is using machine learning to develop a computer model (based in Fortran) that can accurately 
simulate the behaviour of proteins, specifically with the aim of more fundamentally understanding the onset of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. 

My research looked at the energetics of the compression of [topological atoms](https://www.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/aim/aim_3.html) 
and involved testing whether the results were consistent with more traditional models of atoms.

I was involved the design and execution of a set of computational experiments which often had to be created in Python from scratch. 
These were submitted to Gaussian using bash before being run and analysed on a high-performance computer cluster. Data analysis was done 
both localling using Numpy and Matplotlib and on a distributed computing cluster using bash.
