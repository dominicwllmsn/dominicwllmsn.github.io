The Quantum Chemical Topology group is using machine learning to develop a computer model that can accurately 
simulate the behaviour of proteins, specifically with the aim of more fundamentally understanding the onset of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. 
My research involved the design and execution of a set of computational experiments which often had to be created in Python from scratch. 
These were submitted to Gaussian using bash before being run and analysed on a high-performance computer cluster.
