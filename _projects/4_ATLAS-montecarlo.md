This laboratory project involved analysing data from particle physics simulations and real collision data from ATLAS at CERN. The 
simulations were based on Monte Carlo algorithms using the expectation values from particle physics equations. The analysis involved 
computing the cross-sections of different particle decays, making selection cuts to remove background data, and using different fitting 
methods to make estimates of the remaining background data. This project was completed using C++ and ROOT, a data analysis package from 
CERN, to analyse and visualise the data respectively

*Histograms featuring simulation data (red) and real data (blue) for the gg → H → |4 lepton| decay channel and the Z-boson → electron decay. 
The difference between red and blue histograms is a result of irremovable background events (generally due to strong interactions)*
